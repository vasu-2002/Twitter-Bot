Make a file twitterbot_retweet.py and paste the following code:

import tweepy
from time import sleep
from credentials import *
from config import QUERY, FOLLOW, LIKE, SLEEP_TIME

auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)
api = tweepy.API(auth)

print("Twitter bot which retweets, like tweets and follow users")
print("Bot Settings")
print("Like Tweets :", LIKE)
print("Follow users :", FOLLOW)

for tweet in tweepy.Cursor(api.search, q = QUERY).items():
	try:
		print('\nTweet by: @' + tweet.user.screen_name)

		tweet.retweet()
		print('Retweeted the tweet')

		# Favorite the tweet
		if LIKE:
			tweet.favorite()
			print('Favorited the tweet')

		# Follow the user who tweeted
		# check that bot is not already following the user
		if FOLLOW:
			if not tweet.user.following:
				tweet.user.follow()
				print('Followed the user')

		sleep(SLEEP_TIME)

	except tweepy.TweepError as e:
		print(e.reason)

	except StopIteration:
		break
    
    
Now make another file to specify what should your bot do. Name it config.py
Edit the #hashtag according to your choice and the like or follow option to either True or False.
Now copy the following code:

# Edit this config.py file as you like

# This is hastag which Twitter bot will
# search and retweet You can edit this with
# any hastag .For example : '# javascript'

QUERY = '# anything'

# Twitter bot setting for liking Tweets
LIKE = True

# Twitter bot setting for following user who tweeted
FOLLOW = True

# Twitter bot sleep time settings in seconds.
# For example SLEEP_TIME = 300 means 5 minutes.
# Please, use large delay if you are running bot
# all the time so that your account does not
# get banned.

SLEEP_TIME = 300


Next make a file credentials.py and paste your access tokens carefully in between the single quotes ‘ ‘.
Copy the following code:

# This is just a sample file. You need to
# edit this file. You need to get these
# details from your Twitter app settings.

consumer_key = ''
consumer_secret = ''
access_token = ''
access_token_secret = ''
